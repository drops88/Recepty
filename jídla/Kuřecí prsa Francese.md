# Kuřecí prsa Francese

## Suroviny:
- 2 ks kuřecích prsou
- 1/2 hrnku hladké mouky
- 2 vejce
- 1 hrst čerstvé nati z petržele
- 50 g Parmezánu
- 1 hrnek bílého vína
- 1 hrnek kuřecího vývaru
- 1 stroužek česneku
- 4 lžičky olivového oleje
- 4 lžičky másla
- půlka citrónu
- sůl a pepř

## Postup:
1. Crack the eggs into a large enough dish to fit chicken breast. Season eggs with salt and pepper, give them a light beat. Chop the parsley finely (keep a few sprigs for garnish) and add half to egg mixture. Grate all the Parmesan cheese finely and add to egg mixture, mix well. Set aside.
2. Remove chicken skin if any, then butterfly cut your breast. Hold a long sharp knife along the thicker part of the breast, place your hand on top and slice through the breast almost until the end.
3. Cut parallel to your cutting board, and open the breast like a book. Place cling film on a board, add your breast spread open, sandwich it in cling film and flatten the thicker side using the flat side of a meat mallet or the underside of a saucepan. Get your wine and chicken stock portions ready. Add the plain flour to a plate, spread it out flat by shaking plate. Peel the garlic and place in garlic press (or chop finely). To a frying pan on moderate heat, add the olive oil and half the butter. Coat the chicken in the flour, shake off any excess flour. Dip the chicken in the egg wash, make sure it's totally covered and place in hot oil. Cook chicken for approx. 4 minutes each side (depending on thickness). Flip over once brown and cook the other side. Transfer chicken to a hot plate and rest. To the same frying pan on full heat, add the white wine (alcohol can catch fire so be careful, turn off heat first if unsure). Add the chicken stock. Add the crushed garlic. Add the squeeze of half a lemon.  And leave to reduce 2 minutes on high heat. Add the remaining half of chopped parsley. Add the remainder of butter and mix until butter is melted on very low heat. Return the chicken to the sauce and continue heating chicken on low heat no more than 30 seconds. Serve the chicken on warm plates, garnished with parsley.
