# Pizza Sauce â€“ enough for 4 large pizzas

## Suroviny:
- 1 pc of 28 oz container Pomi Strained Tomatoes
- 1 pc of 6 oz Can of Hunt's Tomato Paste
- 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Oregano

## Method:
1. Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix together until smooth.
2. If you have time, let the sauce sit for at least an hour before making your pizza. You want all of the flavors to come together. You can even make the sauce a day ahead and store it in your fridge until you are ready to use it.
